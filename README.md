# weather-app

This weather app is a simple and user-friendly way to get up-to-date weather information for any location in the world. Built using Tkinter and Python, it allows users to enter a city name or zip code and instantly get current weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description.

The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data in real-time, ensuring that the information displayed is always accurate and up-to-date. It also allows users to switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius temperature units, making it convenient for people in different parts of the world.

The user interface is clean and intuitive, with a search bar and a "Search" button that makes it easy for users to quickly find weather information for their desired location. The app also includes error handling to ensure that users are notified if they enter an invalid location or if there is a problem retrieving weather data.

In the future, there are plans to add more features to the app, such as a forecast feature that displays weather information for the next few days, and to improve the user interface to make it more visually appealing.

Overall, this weather app is a great tool for anyone who wants to stay informed about the weather conditions in their area or in any location they're interested in. Whether you're planning a trip, going for a run, or just want to know what to expect when you step outside, this app has got you covered.
